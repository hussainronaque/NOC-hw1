\section*{General instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item For drawing finite automata, see  \href{https://www3.nd.edu/~kogge/courses/cse30151-fa17/Public/other/tikz_tutorial.pdf}{this TikZ guide} or \href{https://www.jflap.org}{the JFLAP tool}. Hand drawn diagrams will not be accepted.
\item Please ensure that your solutions are neatly formatted and organized, and use clear and
concise language.
\item Please consult Canvas for a rubric containing the breakdown of points for each problem.
\item For all the problems below, $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$.
\item Some of the problems below make use of the following count function.
\[
    n_a(w) =  \text{the number of occurences of } a\text{ in } w, \text{ where } a\in\Sigma,w\in\Sigma^*.
\]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problems}
\begin{questions}

\question[15] List 2 members and 2 non-members of the language, $(a \cup ba \cup bb)\Sigma^*$.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}
\question[20] Provide the state diagram of a simplified DFA that recognizes the language, 
  \[
    A=\{w\in\Sigma^* \mid n_a(w) \ge 2, n_b(w) \le 1\}.
  \]
  \begin{solution} 

  \end{solution}

  
\question[30] Given the languages, $A$ and $B$, we derive the language, $C = \{ w\in A \mid w \in B \}$.

  Prove or disprove the following claim.
  \begin{claim}
    If $A$ and $B$ are regular languages, then so is $C$.
  \end{claim}
  
  \begin{solution}
    We have to prove a language C has members : w is member of A given that it is member of B, where A and B are some regular languages then so is C. To accomplish this we can construct a DFA that accepts language C to complete the proof. 

    let $C' = (Q, \sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a DFA that accepts language C. 
    Language A is accepted by DFA A' and language B is accepted by DFA B'
    Let $A' = (Q_A, \sigma, \delta_A, q_{0A}, F_A)$ and $B' = (Q_B, \sigma, \delta_B, q_{0B}, F_B)$

     We can construct C as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $Q = {(q_A, q_B) \mid q_A \in Q_A, q_B \in Q_B}$
      so the new state set Q is the cartesian product of the state sets of A and B.
      \item $\sigma = \sigma_A = \sigma_B$
      (since w $\in$ $\Sigma*$ and $\Sigma =\{a,b\}$ which is same for A and B)
      \item $\delta((q_A, q_B), a) = (\delta_A(q_A, a), \delta_B(q_B, a))$
      \item $q_0 = (q_{0A}, q_{0B})$
      \item $F = F_A \times F_B$
      the start states and end states of C' will be pair of start states and end states of A' and B' respectively.
    \end{itemize}
    Now we have to prove that C' is a DFA that accepts language C.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item C is a DFA because it has a finite set of states, a finite set of input symbols, a transition function, a start state, and a set of end states.
      \item C accepts language C because it accepts all strings w that are accepted by A and B.
    \end{itemize}
    Therefore, C is a DFA that accepts language C, so the claim is true.  

  \end{solution}
  
\question[35] Given the languages, $A$ and $B$, we define the following operation.
  \[
    A\smile_a B = \{ u\in A \mid \exists v\in B \ni n_a(u) = n_a(v) \}
  \]

  Prove or disprove the following claim.
  \begin{claim}
    The class of regular languages is closed under $\smile_a$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{solution}
    
  \end{solution}
